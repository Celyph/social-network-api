# Social Network API

## Description

- My motivation for this project was to create a web application where users can share thoughts, react to posts, and have a list of friends.
- I built this project to work out an understanding of MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM in tandem with Express.js.
- This code is effective in simulating a small scale social network.
- Composing this project, I learned how to better understand and utilize documentation on new comcepts.
